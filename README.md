**Project Description:**

Data Quality Control Initiative at  Review Panel - Focus List - UCE Academic Program Review

**Project Title:**

Implementation of Data Quality Control Measures at UCW, Acedemic Deparment Review Panel - Focus List

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive Data Quality Control (DQC) framework at UCW, Acedemic Deparment Review Panel - Focus List. This framework will ensure the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of the university's data, enhancing decision-making processes and overall business performance.

**Background:**

As UCW, Acedemic Deparment, issues related to data quality have surfaced, including inaccuracies, duplicate records, and inconsistent formats. Poor data quality can lead to misguided business strategies, inefficiencies, and regulatory compliance risks. This project aims to implement robust data quality control measures to mitigate these issues.

**Scope:** 

The project will focus on the following key areas:

•	Data Profiling: Analyzing existing datasets to assess quality levels.

•	Data Cleansing: Developing processes to correct inaccuracies and eliminate duplicates.

•	Data Validation: Implementing validation rules and checks to ensure data integrity.

•	Monitoring and Reporting: Establishing ongoing monitoring processes and dashboards to track data quality metrics.



**Dataset:**

The Review Panel - Focus List dataset consists of information such as:

• Focus-Id: Unique identifier for each focus

• Reviewer-Name: Name of the reviewer

• Primary-Focus: Focus Name

• Focus-Area-1: Focus Area Category 01

• Focus-Area-2: Focus Area Category 02

• Focus-Area-3: Focus Area Category 03 

• Report-Submitted: Submitted the report or not.

**Methodology:**

**1- Current State Assessment:**

o Since I do not have the permission to get the review panel list of UCW, I have generated sample records (50 records)

**2- Data Profiling:**

Conduct an initial assessment of the data quality to identify issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across this dataset. Document data types, formats, and any discrepancies. I used profiling in AWS.


**3- Data Quality Metrics:**

Define clear data quality metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate and track data quality over time, such as error rates, duplicate records, and compliance with data standards.


**4- Data Cleansing Processes:**

Develop and implement procedures for data cleansing, which may include:

o	Removing duplicates and correcting errors.

o	Standardizing data formats and values.

o Filling in missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.

**5- Validation Rules and Procedures:**

Set up validation rules for new data entries to reduce the risk of poor-quality data being introduced into the system. Create data entry guidelines to promote consistency and accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

o Generated reliabile cleaned outputs for any business purposes.

o Tools and Technologies:

• AWS - Amazon S3 / AWS Glue / AWS Data Brew 

This Data Quality Control initiative aims to empower UCW, Acedemic Department to enhance its data integrity and reliability, resulting in improved decision-making, operational efficiency, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
